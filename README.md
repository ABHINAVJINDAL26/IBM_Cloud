# ðŸŽ“ College Admission Agent (RAG-Based)

This project is a smart AI-powered assistant that helps prospective students with college admission queries using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Built on **IBM Watsonx.ai** and powered by **LLaMA-3** or **Granite** large language models, it provides instant, accurate, and document-grounded answers about courses, eligibility, fees, scholarships, and deadlines.

## ðŸ§± Architecture

1. **User Input**: Student asks a question in plain language  
2. **Retriever**: (Optional) Fetches relevant chunks from stored admission documents  
3. **LLM (Watsonx)**: Processes question + context and generates an accurate answer  
4. **Response**: AI returns a grounded, informative answer in real time
